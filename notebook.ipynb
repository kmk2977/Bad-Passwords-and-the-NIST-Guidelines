The NIST Special Publication 800-63B\n<p>If you – 50 years ago – needed to come up with a secret password you were probably part of a secret espionage organization or (more likely) you were pretending to be a spy when playing as a kid. Today, many of us are forced to come up with new passwords <em>all the time</em> when signing into sites and apps. As a password <em>inventeur</em> it is your responsibility to come up with good, hard-to-crack passwords. But it is also in the interest of sites and apps to make sure that you use good passwords. The problem is that it's really hard to define what makes a good password. However, <em>the National Institute of Standards and Technology</em> (NIST) knows what the second best thing is: To make sure you're at least not using a <em>bad</em> password. </p>\n<p>In this notebook, we will go through the rules in <a href=\"https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html\">NIST Special Publication 800-63B</a> which details what checks a <em>verifier</em> (what the NIST calls a second party responsible for storing and verifying passwords) should perform to make sure users don't pick bad passwords. We will go through the passwords of users from a fictional company and use Python to flag the users with bad passwords. But us being able to do this already means the fictional company is breaking one of the rules of 800-63B:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Verifiers SHALL store memorized secrets in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Memorized secrets SHALL be salted and hashed using a suitable one-way key derivation function.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, never save users' passwords in plaintext, always encrypt the passwords! Keeping this in mind for the next time we're building a password management system, let's load in the data.</p>\n<p><em>Warning: The list of passwords and the fictional user database both contain <strong>real</strong> passwords leaked from <strong>real</strong> websites. These passwords have not been filtered in any way and include words that are explicit, derogatory and offensive.</em></p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing the pandas module\n# ...
